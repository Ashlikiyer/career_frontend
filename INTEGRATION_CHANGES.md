# Backend Integration Changes

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to integrate the restructured backend API with the frontend. The main focus was on fixing the assessment flow that was causing "Invalid assessment ID" errors in production.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. API Configuration

- Updated `dataService.tsx` with direct backend URL configuration
- Set baseURL to "http://localhost:5000" for development (change for production)

### 2. Enhanced API Configuration

- Updated axios configuration with `withCredentials: true` for session support
- Added `/api/` prefix to all endpoint calls
- Configured proper CORS handling for production deployments

### 3. Authentication & Session Management

- Added axios interceptors for automatic token handling
- Enhanced error handling for session expiry and authentication failures
- Improved token storage using both localStorage and cookies
- Added automatic redirect to login on authentication failures

### 4. Assessment Flow Updates

- Added `checkAssessmentStatus()` function to detect existing assessments
- Updated `submitAnswer()` to handle new response format with completion detection
- Enhanced error handling for "Invalid assessment session" errors
- Improved session expiry handling with automatic recovery

### 5. New API Functions Added

- `checkAssessmentStatus()` - Check for existing assessment sessions
- `getProfile()` - Get user profile data
- `updateProfile()` - Update user profile
- `deleteRoadmapStep()` - Delete individual roadmap steps
- `ensureValidSession()` - Validate session health

### 6. Updated Function Signatures

- `saveCareer(careerName, assessmentScore)` - Now includes assessment score
- Enhanced error handling in all functions with specific error codes
- Better type safety and error message handling

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The server should start on http://localhost:5174/

2. **Test Authentication Flow:**

   - Register a new user
   - Login with credentials
   - Verify token is stored and API calls include Authorization header

3. **Test Assessment Flow:**

   - Start a new assessment
   - Submit answers and verify session persistence
   - Complete assessment and save career with score
   - Verify no "Invalid assessment ID" errors occur

4. **Test Session Handling:**
   - Refresh page during assessment
   - Verify session persistence across page reloads
   - Test session expiry handling

## Production Deployment Notes

### Frontend Configuration:

- Update `baseURL` in `services/dataService.tsx` from "http://localhost:5000" to your production backend URL
- Example: Change to "https://your-backend-domain.com"

### Backend Environment Variables Required:

```
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-domain.com
```

## Error Handling Improvements

The system now handles these specific error cases:

- `INVALID_ASSESSMENT_SESSION` - Redirects to start new assessment
- `401` Authentication errors - Automatic logout and redirect to login
- `404` Resource not found - Graceful error messages
- Session expiry during assessment - Automatic recovery flow

## File Changes Summary

### Modified Files:

1. `services/dataService.tsx` - Complete rewrite with new API structure
2. `src/pages/Assessment.tsx` - Updated assessment flow and error handling
3. `src/pages/Results.tsx` - Updated to include assessment score when saving careers

### New Features:

- Session-based assessment management
- Enhanced error handling with specific error codes
- Automatic session recovery
- Profile management support
- Improved roadmap functionality

## Next Steps

1. Test the complete user journey from registration to roadmap viewing
2. Verify production deployment with correct CORS settings
3. Monitor for any remaining "Invalid assessment ID" errors
4. Consider implementing offline support for better user experience
